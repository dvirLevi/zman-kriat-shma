This class contains a {@link #getCalendar() Calendar} and can therefore use the standard Calendar\r\n * functionality to change dates etc... The calculation engine used to calculate the astronomical times can be changed\r\n * to a different implementation by implementing the abstract {@link AstronomicalCalculator} and setting it with the\r\n * {@link #setAstronomicalCalculator(AstronomicalCalculator)}. A number of different calculation engine implementations\r\n * are included in the util package.\r\n * <b>Note:</b> There are times when the algorithms can't calculate proper values for sunrise, sunset and twilight. This\r\n * is usually caused by trying to calculate times for areas either very far North or South, where sunrise / sunset never\r\n * happen on that date. This is common when calculating twilight with a deep dip below the horizon for locations as far\r\n * south of the North Pole as London, in the northern hemisphere. The sun never reaches this dip at certain times of the\r\n * year. When the calculations encounter this condition a null will be returned when a\r\n * <code>{@link java.util.Date}</code> is expected and {@link Long#MIN_VALUE} when a <code>long</code> is expected. The\r\n * reason that <code>Exception</code>s are not thrown in these cases is because the lack of a rise/set or twilight is\r\n * not an exception, but an expected condition in many parts of the world.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple example of how to use the API to calculate sunrise.\r\n * First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate sunrise or sunset times for:\r\n *\r\n * <pre>\r\n * String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;\r\n * double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters\r\n * // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid timezone listed in\r\n * // {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}\r\n * TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);\r\n * GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);\r\n * AstronomicalCalendar ac = new AstronomicalCalendar(location);\r\n * </pre>\r\n *\r\n * To get the time of sunrise, first set the date you want (if not set, the date will default to today):\r\n *\r\n * <pre>\r\n * ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);\r\n * ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);\r\n * Date sunrise = ac.getSunrise();\r\n * </pre>\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @author &copy; Eliyahu Hershfeld 2004 - 2016\r\n */\r\nexport class AstronomicalCalendar {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Default constructor will set a default {@link GeoLocation#GeoLocation()}, a default\r\n     * {@link AstronomicalCalculator#getDefault() AstronomicalCalculator} and default the calendar to the current date.\r\n     */\r\n    /*\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this(new GeoLocation());\r\n    }\r\n    */\r\n    /**\r\n     * A constructor that takes in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation\">geolocation</a> information as a\r\n     * parameter.

<em>zmanim</em>\r\n * (religious times) for prayers and other Jewish religious duties. This class contains the main functionality of the\r\n * Zmanim library. For a much more extensive list of zmanim use the {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar} that extends this\r\n * class.

An example would be to calculate\r\n * the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein\">Trumas Hadeshen</a>'s</em> <em>alos</em> to\r\n * <em>tzais</em> based <em>plag hamincha</em> as calculated in the Machzikei Hadass calendar in Manchester, England.\r\n * A number of this calendar's zmanim are calculated based on a day starting at <em>alos</em> of 12&deg; before sunrise\r\n * and ending at <em>tzais</em> of 7.083&deg; after sunset. Be aware that since the <em>alos</em> and <em>tzais</em>\r\n * do not use identical degree based offsets, this leads to <em>chatzos</em> being at a time other than the\r\n * {@link #getSunTransit() solar transit} (solar midday). To calculate this zman, use the following steps. Note that\r\n * <em>plag hamincha</em> is 10.75 hours after the start of the day, and the following steps are all that it takes.\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * Date plag = czc.getPlagHamincha(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),\r\n * \t\t\t\tczc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));</pre>\r\n *\r\n * Something a drop more challenging, but still simple, would be calculating a zman using the same \"complex\" offset day\r\n * used in the above mentioned Manchester calendar, but for a <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> based <em>zman</em> not not\r\n * supported by this library, such as calculating the point that one should be <em>makpid</em>\r\n * not to eat on <em>erev Shabbos</em> or <em>erev Yom Tov</em>. This is 9 <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> into the day.\r\n * <ol>\r\n * \t<li>Calculate the <em>shaah zmanis</em> in milliseconds for this day</li>\r\n * \t<li>Add 9 of these <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> to alos starting at 12&deg;</li>\r\n * </ol>\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * long shaahZmanis = czc.getTemporalHour(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),\r\n * \t\t\t\t\t\tczc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));\r\n * Date sofZmanAchila = getTimeOffset(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),\r\n * \t\t\t\t\tshaahZmanis * 9);</pre>\r\n *\r\n * Calculating this <em>sof zman achila</em> according to the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\">GRA</a></em>\r\n * is simplicity itself.\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * Date sofZmanAchila = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getSunrise(), czc.getShaahZmanisGra() * 9);</pre>\r\n *\r\n * <h2>Documentation from the {@link ZmanimCalendar} parent class</h2>\r\n * {@inheritDoc}\r\n *\r\n * @author &copy; Eliyahu Hershfeld 2004 - 2016\r\n */\r\nexport class ComplexZmanimCalendar extends ZmanimCalendar {\r\n    constructor(location) {\r\n        super(location);\r\n        /**\r\n         * The offset in minutes (defaults to 40) after sunset used for <em>tzeit</em> for Ateret Torah calculations.\r\n         * @see #getTzaisAteretTorah()\r\n         * @see #getAteretTorahSunsetOffset()\r\n         * @see #setAteretTorahSunsetOffset(double)\r\n         */\r\n        this.ateretTorahSunsetOffset = 40;\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Default constructor will set a default {@link GeoLocation#GeoLocation()}, a default\r\n     * {@link AstronomicalCalculator#getDefault() AstronomicalCalculator} and default the calendar to the current date.\r\n     *\r\n     * @see AstronomicalCalendar#AstronomicalCalendar()\r\n     */\r\n    /*\r\n        public ComplexZmanimCalendar() {\r\n            super();\r\n        }\r\n    */\r\n    /**\r\n     * Method to return a <em>shaah zmanis</em> (temporal hour) calculated using a 19.8&deg; dip.
