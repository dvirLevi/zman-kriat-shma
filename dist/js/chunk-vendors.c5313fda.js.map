This class contains a {@link #getCalendar() Calendar} and can therefore use the standard Calendar\r\n * functionality to change dates etc... The calculation engine used to calculate the astronomical times can be changed\r\n * to a different implementation by implementing the abstract {@link AstronomicalCalculator} and setting it with the\r\n * {@link #setAstronomicalCalculator(AstronomicalCalculator)}. A number of different calculation engine implementations\r\n * are included in the util package.\r\n * <b>Note:</b> There are times when the algorithms can't calculate proper values for sunrise, sunset and twilight. This\r\n * is usually caused by trying to calculate times for areas either very far North or South, where sunrise / sunset never\r\n * happen on that date. This is common when calculating twilight with a deep dip below the horizon for locations as far\r\n * south of the North Pole as London, in the northern hemisphere. The sun never reaches this dip at certain times of the\r\n * year. When the calculations encounter this condition a null will be returned when a\r\n * <code>{@link java.util.Date}</code> is expected and {@link Long#MIN_VALUE} when a <code>long</code> is expected. The\r\n * reason that <code>Exception</code>s are not thrown in these cases is because the lack of a rise/set or twilight is\r\n * not an exception, but an expected condition in many parts of the world.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple example of how to use the API to calculate sunrise.\r\n * First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate sunrise or sunset times for:\r\n *\r\n * <pre>\r\n * String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;\r\n * double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters\r\n * // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid timezone listed in\r\n * // {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}\r\n * TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);\r\n * GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);\r\n * AstronomicalCalendar ac = new AstronomicalCalendar(location);\r\n * </pre>\r\n *\r\n * To get the time of sunrise, first set the date you want (if not set, the date will default to today):\r\n *\r\n * <pre>\r\n * ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);\r\n * ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);\r\n * Date sunrise = ac.getSunrise();\r\n * </pre>\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @author &copy; Eliyahu Hershfeld 2004 - 2016\r\n */\r\nexport class AstronomicalCalendar {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Default constructor will set a default {@link GeoLocation#GeoLocation()}, a default\r\n     * {@link AstronomicalCalculator#getDefault() AstronomicalCalculator} and default the calendar to the current date.\r\n     */\r\n    /*\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this(new GeoLocation());\r\n    }\r\n    */\r\n    /**\r\n     * A constructor that takes in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation\">geolocation</a> information as a\r\n     * parameter.

<em>zmanim</em>\r\n * (religious times) for prayers and other Jewish religious duties. This class contains the main functionality of the\r\n * Zmanim library. For a much more extensive list of zmanim use the {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar} that extends this\r\n * class. See documentation for the {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar} and {@link AstronomicalCalendar} for simple examples\r\n * on using the API. According to Rabbi Dovid Yehudah Bursztyn in his <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/659793988\">\r\n * Zmanim Kehilchasam (second edition published in 2007)</a> chapter 2 (pages 186-187) no zmanim besides sunrise and\r\n * sunset should use elevation. However Rabbi Yechiel Avrahom Zilber in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/51654\">\r\n * Birur Halacha Vol. 6</a> Ch. 58 Pages <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51654&amp;pgnum=42\">34</a>\r\n * and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51654&amp;pgnum=50\">42</a> is of the opinion that elevation\r\n * should be accounted for in zmanim calculations. Related to this, Rabbi Yaakov Karp in <a href=\r\n * \"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919472094\">Shimush Zekeinim</a>, Ch. 1, page 17 states that obstructing horizons should\r\n * be factored into zmanim calculations. The setting defaults to false (elevation will not be used for zmanim calculations),\r\n * unless the setting is changed to true in {@link #setUseElevation(boolean)}. This will impact sunrise and sunset based\r\n * zmanim such as {@link #getSunrise()}, {@link #getSunset()}, {@link #getSofZmanShmaGRA()}, alos based zmanim such as\r\n * {@link #getSofZmanShmaMGA()} that are based on a fixed offset of sunrise or sunset and zmanim based on a percentage of\r\n * the day such as {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar#getSofZmanShmaMGA90MinutesZmanis()} that are based on sunrise and sunset.\r\n * It will not impact zmanim that are a degree based offset of sunrise and sunset, such as\r\n * {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar#getSofZmanShmaMGA16Point1Degrees()} or {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar#getSofZmanShmaBaalHatanya()}.\r\n *\r\n * <p><b>Note:</b> It is important to read the technical notes on top of the {@link AstronomicalCalculator} documentation\r\n * before using this code.\r\n * <p>I would like to thank Rabbi Yaakov Shakow, the author of Luach Ikvei Hayom who spent a considerable amount of time\r\n * reviewing, correcting and making suggestions on the documentation in this library.\r\n * <h2>Disclaimer:</h2> I did my best to get accurate results, but please double-check before relying on these zmanim for\r\n *\r\n * @author &copy; Eliyahu Hershfeld 2004 - 2019\r\n */\r\nexport class ZmanimCalendar extends AstronomicalCalendar {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Default constructor will set a default {@link GeoLocation#GeoLocation()}, a default\r\n     * {@link AstronomicalCalculator#getDefault() AstronomicalCalculator} and default the calendar to the current date.\r\n     *\r\n     * @see AstronomicalCalendar#AstronomicalCalendar()\r\n     */\r\n    /*\r\n        public ZmanimCalendar() {\r\n            super();\r\n        }\r\n    */\r\n    /**\r\n     * A constructor that takes a {@link GeoLocation} as a parameter.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param location\r\n     *            the location\r\n     */\r\n    constructor(location) {\r\n        super(location);\r\n        /**\r\n         * Is elevation factored in for some zmanim (see {@link #isUseElevation()} for additional information).\r\n         * @see #isUseElevation()\r\n         * @see #setUseElevation(boolean)\r\n         */\r\n        this.useElevation = false;\r\n        /**\r\n         * The default <em>Shabbos</em> candle lighting offset is 18 minutes.

Here are some examples.\r\n * <p>First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate:\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;\r\n * double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ\r\n * double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters\r\n * // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid timezone listed in\r\n * // {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}\r\n * TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);\r\n * GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);\r\n * ComplexZmanimCalendar czc = new ComplexZmanimCalendar(location);\r\n * // Optionally set the date or it will default to today's date\r\n * czc.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);\r\n * czc.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);</pre>\r\n *\r\n * <b>Note:</b> For locations such as Israel where the beginning and end of daylight savings time can fluctuate from\r\n * year to year, if your version of Java does not have an <a href=\r\n * \"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tzdata-versions-138805.html\">up to date timezone database</a>, create a\r\n * {@link java.util.SimpleTimeZone} with the known start and end of DST.\r\n * To get <em>alos</em> calculated as 14&deg; below the horizon (as calculated in the calendars published in Montreal),\r\n * add {@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} (90) to the 14&deg; offset to get the desired time:\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n *  Date alos14 = czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 14);</pre>\r\n *\r\n * To get <em>mincha gedola</em> calculated based on the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombinern\"\r\n * >Magen Avraham (MGA)</a></em> using a <em>shaah zmanis</em> based on the day starting\r\n * 16.1&deg; below the horizon (and ending 16.1&deg; after sunset) the following calculation can be used:\r\n\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * Date minchaGedola = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees() * 6.5);</pre>\r\n * <p>\r\n * or even simpler using the included convenience methods\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * Date minchaGedola = czc.getMinchaGedola(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees());</pre>\r\n *\r\n * A little more complex example would be calculating zmanim that rely on a <em>shaah zmanis</em> that is\r\n * not present in this library. While a drop more complex, it is still rather easy. An example would be to calculate\r\n * the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein\">Trumas Hadeshen</a>'s</em> <em>alos</em> to\r\n * <em>tzais</em> based <em>plag hamincha</em> as calculated in the Machzikei Hadass calendar in Manchester, England.\r\n * A number of this calendar's zmanim are calculated based on a day starting at <em>alos</em> of 12&deg; before sunrise\r\n * and ending at <em>tzais</em> of 7.083&deg; after sunset. Be aware that since the <em>alos</em> and <em>tzais</em>\r\n * do not use identical degree based offsets, this leads to <em>chatzos</em> being at a time other than the\r\n * {@link #getSunTransit() solar transit} (solar midday). To calculate this zman, use the following steps. Note that\r\n * <em>plag hamincha</em> is 10.75 hours after the start of the day, and the following steps are all that it takes.\r\n *\r\n * <pre style=\"background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">\r\n * Date plag = czc.getPlagHamincha(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),\r\n * \t\t\t\tczc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));</pre>\r\n *\r\n * Something a drop more challenging, but still simple, would be calculating a zman using the same \"complex\" offset day\r\n * used in the above mentioned Manchester calendar, but for a <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> based <em>zman</em> not not\r\n * supported by this library, such as calculating the point that one should be <em>makpid</em>\r\n * not to eat on <em>erev Shabbos</em> or <em>erev Yom Tov</em>.
